    "## What is Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is a method in NLP used to classify the emotion (or tone) and subjectiveness of human language. At the most common and basic level, the goal is to classify a text as positive, negative, or neutral in tone, and to determine how subjective it is. The aspect of subjectivity will only very briefly be noted in this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a more complex level, sentiment analysis is a technique used to classify the specific emotions in human language, such as angry, happy, sad, excited, etc. So instead of simply learning/classifying three classes (positive, negative, neutral), the goal is to involve many specific classes."

    "## Why Use Sentiment Analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual usefulness of sentiment analysis depends on the industry using it, but the most common reason to use it involve scraping lots of data (e.g. twitter feeds or reddit comments) to determine how customers/users feel about a particular brand, product, or service. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a use for sentiment analysis when analyzing financial securities (stock market): if a large proportion of people shift in sentiment about a particular market or stock, that is going to affect the price of securities involved."
